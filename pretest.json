      "question": "What is a hash function?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A function that converts data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "b": "A function that encrypts data to ensure its security during transmission.",
        "c": "A function that compresses data to reduce its size.",
        "d": "A function that validates data integrity by appending a checksum."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! A hash function converts data of arbitrary size into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Hash functions do not encrypt data; they convert it into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While hash functions may appear to compress data, their primary purpose is to convert data into a fixed-size string of bytes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Hash functions are primarily used for generating a fixed-size string of bytes from input data, rather than appending a checksum for data integrity."

      "question": "What is collision resistance in the context of hash functions?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It ensures that the hash function produces a unique output for each unique input.",
        "b": "It ensures that it is computationally infeasible to find two distinct inputs that hash to the same value.",
        "c": "It ensures that given a hash value, it is computationally infeasible to find any input that hashes to that value.",
        "d": "It ensures that given an input, it is computationally infeasible to find another input that hashes to the same value."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This describes the property of a hash function called uniqueness.",
        "b": "Correct! Collision resistance ensures that it is computationally infeasible to find two distinct inputs that hash to the same value.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This describes the property of a hash function called preimage resistance.",
